Function31 is a blog initiated by g31 cohort of the Galvanize Full Stack Development Program at the Platte campus in Denver, CO. Our class is comprised of 28 students from a diverse range of professional backgrounds and walks of life, who are passionate about programming and collaborative learning.

Through Function31, we strive to, not only document our coding journey, but also to reflect our diverse array of interests and capture the unique experience of every individual. Our mission is to create a forum for shared ideas, inspiration, and knowledge within the Galvanize community as well as the greater tech community. We encourage submissions of all varieties and forms, whether it be code, video, or a written post expressing your story. All contributions are welcome!
